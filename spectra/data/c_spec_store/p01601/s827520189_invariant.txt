```c
int rev(int n)
    // Precondition: `n` is a non-negative integer.
    // Postcondition: The function returns the integer `n` with its digits reversed.

int main(void)
    // Input format: A single integer `n` is read from standard input.
    // Output format: A single integer (the closest palindrome to `n`) is printed to standard output.
    // Precondition: `n` is a non-negative integer.
    // Postcondition: The closest palindrome integer to `n` is found and printed. If there are two palindromes at the same distance, the smaller one is printed.
