```c
// Global variables
int n;
int yaku[101] = {0};

// Given an integer `a`, this function returns the count of integers `i` (2 <= i <= n)
// such that yaku[i] is greater than or equal to `a-1`.
int num(int a)
    // No calls to other functions

// This function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the number of ways to express `n!`
// as a product of exactly 75 divisors. It does this by factorizing all numbers from 2 to `n`
// and storing the count of each prime factor in the array `yaku`.
// It then calculates the number of ways to achieve the desired factorization using a formula.
int main(void)
    Calls num(...)
