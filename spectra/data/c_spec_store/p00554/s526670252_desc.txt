```c
// Global variables
int a[1000], b[1000];

// Main function
// Reads two integers `n` and `m`.
// Then reads `m` pairs of integers into arrays `a` and `b`.
// If an element in `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it sets both `a` and `b` at that index to 0 and increments `count1`.
// If `m-1` is greater than `count1`, it processes the array `b` to store the difference between `n` and elements in `a`.
// Sorts the array `b` and accumulates the sum of the first `m-count1-1` elements of `b` into `count2`.
// Finally, prints `count2`.
