```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains a string `str1`.
    // The second line contains a string `str2`.
    // Output format: A single word "Yes" or "No" followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: Both strings `str1` and `str2` are non-empty and their combined length does not exceed 400 characters.
    // Postcondition: The program prints "Yes" if `str2` is a substring of the concatenation of `str1` with itself, otherwise it prints "No".
