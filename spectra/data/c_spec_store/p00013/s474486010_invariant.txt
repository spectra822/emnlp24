```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: A sequence of integers, each on a new line. The sequence ends with EOF.
    // Output format: A sequence of integers, each printed on a new line.
    // Precondition: The input consists of integers. If an integer is zero, it indicates a car leaving the railroad.
    // Postcondition: The program simulates cars entering and leaving a railroad. For each zero in the input, it prints the last car that entered and has not yet left. The program terminates when EOF is encountered.
