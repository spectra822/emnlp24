```c
// Global variables
int railroad[10] = {};

// Main function
// This function simulates a simple stack-based railroad system where:
// - Positive integers represent cars entering the system and being pushed onto the stack.
// - A zero represents a car leaving the system and being popped from the stack, with its value printed.
// The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input until EOF and processes them accordingly.
int main(void)
    // Calls to no other functions
