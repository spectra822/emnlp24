    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The second line contains a string `string` of length `n`.
    // Output format: A single integer, the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring "ABC".
    // Precondition: `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.
    // The length of `string` is equal to `n`.
