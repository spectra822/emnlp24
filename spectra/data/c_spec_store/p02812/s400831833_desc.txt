```c
// Global variables
int n = 0;
char string[51] = {};

// Main function to find the count of the pattern "ABC" in a given string.
// It reads an integer `n` and a string `string` of length `n`.
// Then it iterates through the string to count occurrences of the pattern "ABC".
// If the pattern is found, it increments the count and skips the next two characters to avoid overlapping patterns.
int main(void)
    // No calls to other functions
```
