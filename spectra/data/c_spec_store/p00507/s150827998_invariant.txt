```c
int cmp(int *a, int *b)
    // Precondition: Pointers `a` and `b` point to valid integers.
    // Postcondition: Returns 1 if the integer pointed to by `a` is greater than the integer pointed to by `b`, otherwise returns 0.

int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `N`.
    // The next `N` lines each contain an integer.
    // Output format: A single number.
    // Precondition: The global variables `N`, `A`, and `R` have been declared.
    // Postcondition: The smallest 3rd concatenated number of any two different elements in the array `A` is printed.
