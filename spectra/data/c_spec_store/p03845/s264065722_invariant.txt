```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines each contain an integer `t[i]`.
    // The next line contains an integer `m`.
    // The next `m` lines each contain two integers `p[i]` and `x[i]`, separated by a whitespace.
    // Output format: `m` lines, each containing a single integer.
    // Precondition: The integers `n` and `m` are non-negative and do not exceed 100.
    // The arrays `t`, `p`, and `x` have been declared with sizes sufficient to hold up to 100 elements.
    // Postcondition: For each pair of `p[i]` and `x[i]`, the program prints the sum of the array `t` with the `p[i]`-th element replaced by `x[i]`.
