```c
int p(int n)
    // Precondition: The input parameter `n` is a non-negative integer.
    // Postcondition: The function returns the number of divisors of `n` greater than 1.

int main()
    // Input format: A sequence of integers, each on a new line. The sequence is terminated by the integer 0.
    // Output format: For each input integer `l`, the output is an integer on a new line, representing the difference between the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `l` and the largest prime number less than or equal to `l`.
    // Precondition: The input is a sequence of non-negative integers terminated by a 0.
    // Postcondition: For each input integer `l`, the difference between the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `l` and the largest prime number less than or equal to `l` is printed on a new line. The program terminates after processing the input sequence.
