```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains three integers separated by spaces.
    // The second line contains three integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer printed on a new line.
    // Precondition: The input consists of exactly two lines, each containing three integers.
    // Postcondition: The program calculates the squared distance between two points (x[0], y[0]) and (x[1], y[1])
    // and compares it with the squared sums and differences of their respective radii.
    // Based on these comparisons, it outputs an integer from 0 to 4:
    // 4 if the distance is greater than the sum of the radii,
    // 3 if the distance equals the sum of the radii,
    // 2 if the distance is between the sum and the absolute difference of the radii,
    // 1 if the distance equals the absolute difference of the radii,
    // 0 if the distance is less than the absolute difference of the radii.
