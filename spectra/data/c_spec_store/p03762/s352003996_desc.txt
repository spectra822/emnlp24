```c
// Global variables
// There are no global variables in this program.

// The main function reads input values, processes them, and prints the result.
// It takes two integers `n` and `m` representing the sizes of two arrays.
// It reads the elements of two arrays `x` and `y`.
// It calculates two values `t` and `k` based on the elements of the arrays
// and prints the product of `t` and `k` modulo 1000000007.
int main(void)
    // No calls to other functions
