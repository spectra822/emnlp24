```c
// No global variables

// Given an integer `n`, a count `c`, and a lower bound `low`,
// recursively determine the number of ways to represent `n` as the sum of up to four squares.
// It returns the count of such representations.
int solve(int n, int c, int low)
    Calls solve(...)

// The main function for reading input integers and calculating the number of representations
// of each integer as the sum of up to four squares using `solve` function.
// It reads integers until a zero is encountered.
int main()
    Calls solve(...)
