```c
int in()
    // Precondition: None
    // Postcondition: Reads a non-negative integer from input and returns it.

void topological_sort()
    // Precondition: The global variables `V`, `to`, `hi`, `q`, `top`, `end`, and `count` have been initialized.
    // Postcondition: Prints the vertices of the graph in topologically sorted order, each on a new line.

int main()
    // Input format: 
    // The first line contains two integers `V` and `E`.
    // The next `E` lines contain two integers `s` and `t`, each representing a directed edge from `s` to `t`.
    // Output format: 
    // The vertices in topologically sorted order, each printed on a new line.
    // Precondition: The graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    // Postcondition: The vertices of the DAG are printed in topologically sorted order.
