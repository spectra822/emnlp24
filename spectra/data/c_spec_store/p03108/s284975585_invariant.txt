```c
int root(int x)
    // Precondition: The global array `par` has been initialized such that each element is its own parent or points to another element.
    // Postcondition: The root element of the set containing `x` is returned, with path compression applied to the elements along the path.

int unite(int x, int y)
    // Precondition: The global array `par` has been initialized such that each element is its own parent or points to another element.
    // Postcondition: The set containing `x` is merged with the set containing `y`. If `x` and `y` were already in the same set, 0 is returned. Otherwise, 1 is returned.

int same(int x, int y)
    // Precondition: The global array `par` has been initialized such that each element is its own parent or points to another element.
    // Postcondition: Returns 1 if `x` and `y` are in the same set, otherwise returns 0.

int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `n` and `m`.
    // The next `m` lines each contain two integers `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
    // Output format: `m` lines, each containing a single integer.
    // Precondition: The global arrays `a`, `b`, `par`, `root_cnt`, and `ans` have been declared. The input values for `n` and `m` have been read.
    // Postcondition: The number of possible ways to choose two different vertices that are in different connected components is printed for each step in the reverse order of edge addition.
