```c
// Global variables
char s[51][60];

// Main function that reads the dimensions of a grid `H` and `W`, and then reads the grid contents.
// It checks each cell in the grid to see if it contains a '#' character. If a '#' character is found,
// it verifies whether any adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) also contains a '#' character.
// If no adjacent cell contains a '#', the function prints "No" and exits.
// If all '#' characters have at least one adjacent '#', the function prints "Yes".
int main()
  // No calls to other functions
