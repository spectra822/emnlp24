```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `H` and `W`.
    // The next `H` lines each contain a string of length `W` consisting of characters '.' and '#'.
    // Output format: A single word, either "Yes" or "No".
    // Precondition: The input grid `s` has dimensions `H` x `W` and contains only the characters '.' and '#'.
    // Postcondition: The program prints "Yes" if every '#' character in the grid has at least one adjacent '#' character 
    // (up, down, left, or right). Otherwise, it prints "No".
