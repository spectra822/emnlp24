```c
int cmp(const void *s, const void *b)
    // Precondition: The pointers `s` and `b` point to valid integers.
    // Postcondition: Returns a positive value if the integer pointed to by `b` is greater than the integer pointed to by `s`, zero if they are equal, and a negative value otherwise.

int main(void)
    // Input format: Multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (number of elements in the array). The next `n` integers are the elements of the array `a`. A test case with `n = 0` indicates the end of input.
    // Output format: For each test case, print the integer `k` if the color (integer) `k` appears more than half the time. Otherwise, print "NO COLOR".
    // Precondition: The global array `a` has been declared. The input is provided in the specified format.
    // Postcondition: For each test case, either the integer `k` that appears more than half the time is printed, or "NO COLOR" is printed if no such integer exists.
