// This program simulates traversing a state machine with a given input path.
// The state machine has 6 states (A, X, Y, Z, W, B) and a transition map `map`.
// It reads paths from the input and determines if they end in state B.
//
// The program reads input paths until a path starting with '#' is encountered.
// For each path, it simulates the state transitions according to the `map`,
// and prints "Yes" if the path ends in state B, otherwise prints "No".
int main(void)
    // No calls to other functions
