```c
void run (void)
    // Precondition: The function expects three integers to be read from standard input, followed by an array of integers.
    // Postcondition: The maximum value calculated based on the given logic is printed to standard output.

int main (void)
    // Input format: The first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, separated by spaces.
    // The second line contains `n` integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer printed on a new line.
    // Precondition: The `run` function is defined and can be executed.
    // Postcondition: The `run` function is called, and its output is printed.
