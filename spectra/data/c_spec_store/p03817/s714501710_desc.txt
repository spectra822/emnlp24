```c
// Global variables
bool flag;

// Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
ll gcd(ll a, ll b)

// Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
ll lcm(ll a, ll b)

// Returns the maximum of two numbers `a` and `b`.
ll max(ll a, ll b)

// Returns the minimum of two numbers `a` and `b`.
ll min(ll a, ll b)

// Comparator function for sorting in ascending order.
ll asc(const void* a, const void* b)

// Comparator function for sorting in descending order.
ll dsc(const void* a, const void* b)

// This function calculates a value based on the input `n`.
// It reads an integer `n` from standard input.
// If `n` is divisible by 11, it sets `res` to 0.
// If the remainder of `n` divided by 11 is between 1 and 6 (inclusive), it sets `res` to 1.
// For other remainders, it sets `res` to 2.
// It then calculates `ans` as `(n / 11 * 2) + res` and prints `ans`.
