```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `N`.
    // The next line contains `N` integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single string, either "YES" or "NO".
    // Precondition: The variable `N` is declared and will be initialized with a positive integer value.
    // The array `A` is declared with a size sufficient to hold `N+1` elements.
    // Postcondition: The program will output "YES" if the conditions specified in the algorithm are met, otherwise "NO".
