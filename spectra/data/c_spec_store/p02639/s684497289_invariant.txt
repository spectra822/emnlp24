```c
int main()
    // Input format: A single line containing five integers a, b, c, d, and e, separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The input integers a, b, c, d, and e have been declared.
    // Postcondition: The program prints the position (1-based index) of the first zero in the input integers. If no zero is found, no output is produced.
