// Global variables
char names[50][32] = {"kogakubu10gokan"};
char* answer = names[0];

// Main function that reads input, processes the data, and prints the result.
// It reads the number of names `N` and a threshold year `Q`.
// Then, for each name, it reads the associated year and the name itself.
// If the year is less than or equal to `Q`, it updates the answer to the name read.
// Finally, it prints the selected name.
