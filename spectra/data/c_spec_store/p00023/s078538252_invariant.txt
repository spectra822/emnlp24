```c
#define SQ(x) ((x) * (x))
    // Precondition: x is a numeric value.
    // Postcondition: The square of x is returned.

<main function signature>
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `2n` lines contain six double values each: `a.x`, `a.y`, `a.r`, `b.x`, `b.y`, `b.r`, separated by whitespace.
    // Output format: For each pair of circles, the program outputs a single integer on a new line.
    // Precondition: The program reads `n` pairs of circles from stdin.
    // Postcondition: For each pair of circles, the program prints:
    // - "0" if the circles do not intersect.
    // - "1" if the circles intersect at one or two points.
    // - "2" if one circle is completely inside the other without touching.
    // - "-2" if the other circle is completely inside the first without touching.
