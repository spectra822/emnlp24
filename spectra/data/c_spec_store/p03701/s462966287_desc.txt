```c
// Global variables
// None

// This function reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` integers into an array `s`.
// It calculates the sum `k` of the elements in `s` and finds the minimum element `min`
// among the elements that are not multiples of 10. If the sum `k` is a multiple of 10,
// it adjusts the sum by subtracting the smallest element that is not a multiple of 10.
// If no such element exists, it sets the answer to 0.
// Finally, it prints the result `ans`.
int main(void)
    // No calls to other functions
