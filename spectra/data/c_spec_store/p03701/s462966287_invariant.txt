```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines contain an integer.
    // Output format: A single integer.
    // Precondition: The input integer `n` is positive.
    // Postcondition: The program prints the sum of the input integers, modified by the given rules. If the sum is a multiple of 10 and there is no non-multiple of 10, the output is 0. Otherwise, the smallest non-multiple of 10 is subtracted from the sum if the sum is a multiple of 10.
