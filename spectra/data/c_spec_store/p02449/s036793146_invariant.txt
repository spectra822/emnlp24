```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    //               The next `n` lines contain an integer `A[i]`.
    // Output format: If `n == 1`, print "1".
    //                Otherwise, print three sequences:
    //                - The previous permutation of `A`.
    //                - The original sequence `A`.
    //                - The next permutation of `A`.
    //                Each sequence should be printed on a new line with elements separated by spaces.
    // Precondition: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
    //               Each `A[i]` is an integer.
    // Postcondition: The previous permutation, the original sequence, and the next permutation of `A` are printed, each on a new line.
