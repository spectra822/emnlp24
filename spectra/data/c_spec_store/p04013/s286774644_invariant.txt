```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `N` and `A`, separated by a whitespace.
    // The next `N` lines each contain a single integer `x[i]`.
    // Output format: A single number.
    // Precondition: `N` and `A` are positive integers. The array `x` has been declared with size `N+1`.
    // Postcondition: The number of ways to choose some non-empty subset of `x` such that the average of the chosen elements is exactly `A` is printed.
