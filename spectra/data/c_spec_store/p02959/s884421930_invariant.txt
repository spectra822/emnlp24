```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `N`.
    // The next `N+1` lines contain integers `A[1]` to `A[N+1]` separated by spaces.
    // The next `N` lines contain integers `B[1]` to `B[N]` separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer on a new line.
    // Precondition: The variable `N` has been declared. Arrays `A` and `B` have been declared with sufficient size.
    // Postcondition: The sum `S` of the maximum elements that can be paired from `A` and `B` according to the program's logic is printed.
