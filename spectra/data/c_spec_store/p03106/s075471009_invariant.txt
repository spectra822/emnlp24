    // Input format: Three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers.
    // Postcondition: The `c`-th common divisor of `a` and `b` is printed to the standard output.
