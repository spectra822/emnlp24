```c
// Global variables
// None

// This function reads an integer N, then reads N strings into an array `s`.
// It then reads an integer M, followed by M strings into an array `t`.
// It calculates the maximum value of the difference between the number of occurrences of any string in `s` and its occurrences in `t`.
// It finally prints this maximum value.
int main(void)
  // Calls: scanf, strcmp, printf
