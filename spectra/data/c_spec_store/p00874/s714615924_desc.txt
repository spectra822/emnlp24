```c
// Global variables
// None

// The main function reads input, processes data and prints the result.
// It continues reading pairs of integers `w` and `d` until a pair of zeros is encountered.
// For each pair, it reads `w` integers into array `a` and `d` integers into array `b`.
// It then calculates the result by summing up the maximum counts of each integer from 1 to 20 in both arrays,
// multiplied by the integer itself.
// Finally, it prints the result for each pair.
int main(void)
  Calls max(...)
