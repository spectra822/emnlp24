```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains three integers `N`, `A`, and `B`, separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single line containing either "Alice" or "Borys", followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The variables `N`, `A`, and `B` are integers such that 1 <= A < B <= N.
    // Postcondition: The program prints "Alice" if the difference between `B` and `A` is even, otherwise prints "Borys".
```
