```
int cmp(const void *a, const void *b)
    // Precondition: `a` and `b` are pointers to valid `node` structures.
    // Postcondition: Returns a negative value if the sum of `s` and `w` of the first node is less than that of the second node, zero if they are equal, and a positive value otherwise.

void run(void)
    // Precondition: The input format is correct and contains an integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing three integers `w`, `s`, and `v`.
    // Postcondition: The maximum value that can be obtained from the given items without exceeding the strength constraints is computed and printed.

int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines each contain three integers `w`, `s`, and `v`, separated by whitespaces.
    // Output format: A single integer value.
    // Precondition: None.
    // Postcondition: Executes the `run` function and returns 0.
