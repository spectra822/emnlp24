    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines each contain two integers `x` and `y`, separated by a whitespace.
    // Output format: A single integer.
    // Precondition: The global arrays `x` and `y` have been declared with a size of at least 1001.
    // Postcondition: The minimum sum of absolute differences between the coordinates is printed.
