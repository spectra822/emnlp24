```c
// Global variables
int a[MAX_N];
int f[MAX_N];

// Convert input to an integer.
// Reads characters until a non-digit character is encountered.
int in()
  Calls gc()

// This function finds the length of the smallest contiguous subarray that contains all integers from 1 to K at least once.
// If no such subarray exists, it prints "0".
// It takes N (length of the array) and K (the number to be present in the subarray) as input.
// Then it takes N integers as the array elements.
int main()
  Calls in()
