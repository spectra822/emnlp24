```c
int in()
    // Precondition: The function `gc()` is defined to read a character from input.
    // Postcondition: Reads an integer from input, consisting of digits, and returns it.

int main()
    // Input format: 
    // The first line contains two integers `N` and `K` separated by a space.
    // The second line contains `N` integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The global arrays `a` and `f` have been declared with size `MAX_N`.
    // Postcondition: Prints the length of the smallest contiguous subarray containing at least one of each integer from 1 to `K`. If no such subarray exists, prints `0`.
