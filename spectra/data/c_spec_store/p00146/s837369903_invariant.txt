```c
double f(int i, int j, int k)
    // Precondition: The global arrays `b` and `c` have been initialized with `n` elements.
    // Postcondition: Returns the calculated value based on the formula involving indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.

int main()
    // Input format: 
    // - The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // - The next `n` lines each contain three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, separated by spaces.
    // Output format: 
    // - A single line containing `n` integers `a` in a specific order, separated by spaces.
    // Precondition: The global arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` have been declared and are large enough to hold `n` elements.
    // Postcondition: The program calculates and prints the order of elements in `a` leading to the minimum calculated value.
