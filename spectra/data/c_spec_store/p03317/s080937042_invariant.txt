```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, separated by a whitespace.
    // The next line contains `n` integers, separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= k <= n`.
    // Postcondition: The program calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to reduce the array `a` to a single element by repeatedly removing `k` elements at a time and keeping the maximum of them.
