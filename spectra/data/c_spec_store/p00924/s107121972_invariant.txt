```
int solve(char bit[], int runlen[], int len, int runlenlen, char start)
    // Precondition: The arrays `bit` and `runlen` have been initialized with at least `len` and `runlenlen` elements respectively.
    // Postcondition: The function returns the minimum number of swaps needed to reorder the bit string `bit` to start with `start` character.

int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `N` and `M` separated by a space.
    // The next line contains `N` characters (`1` or `0`) separated by spaces.
    // The next line contains `M` integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The global arrays `b` and `p` have been declared.
    // Postcondition: The minimum number of swaps required to reorder the bit string `b` according to the run lengths in `p` is printed.
