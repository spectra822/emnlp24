```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `N`.
    // The second line contains a string `S1` of length `N`.
    // The third line contains a string `S2` of length `N`.
    // Output format: A single number.
    // Precondition: `N` is a non-negative integer, and `S1` and `S2` are strings of length `N`.
    // Postcondition: The program calculates and prints the value of `ans` which represents the number of ways to arrange the tiles modulo 1000000007.
