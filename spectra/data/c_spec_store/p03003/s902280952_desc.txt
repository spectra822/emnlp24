```c
// Global variables
long long dp[2010][2010];
#define mod 1000000007

// This function reads two sequences s and t of lengths n and m respectively.
// It then calculates the number of ways to interleave s and t such that the resulting sequence is lexicographically sorted.
// The result is printed as output.
int main()
  // Uses the global variable `dp` to store intermediate results.
  // No function calls within main.
