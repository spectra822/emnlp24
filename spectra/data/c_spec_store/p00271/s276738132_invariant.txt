```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The input consists of 7 lines. Each line contains two integers `a` and `b`, separated by a space.
    // Output format: The output consists of 7 lines. Each line contains one integer, which is the result of `a - b`.
    // Precondition: None
    // Postcondition: For each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from the input, the difference `a - b` is printed on a new line.
