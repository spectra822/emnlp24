```
main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines contain an integer `a[i]`, separated by whitespace.
    // Output format: A single word "Yes" or "No".
    // Precondition: The global variables `n` and `a` have been declared.
    // Postcondition: The program checks if it is possible to make the array non-decreasing by decrementing at most one element at each index. If possible, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
