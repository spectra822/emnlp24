```
ll getlong()
    // Precondition: The global pointer `p` points to a valid null-terminated string containing digits.
    // Postcondition: The function returns a long long integer parsed from the string pointed to by `p`.
    // The pointer `p` is advanced to the next non-digit character after the parsed number.

int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The second line contains `n` integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single long long integer.
    // Precondition: The global buffer `buf` and pointer `p` have been declared.
    // Postcondition: The minimum cost to merge the given sequence of integers is printed.
