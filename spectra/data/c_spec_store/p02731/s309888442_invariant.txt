```c
int main ()
    // Input format: A single integer `l` on a line by itself.
    // Output format: A single floating-point number `x` with 12 decimal places, followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: `l` is a non-negative integer.
    // Postcondition: The program calculates `y` as `l / 3.0`, then `x` as `y * y * y`, and prints `x` with 12 decimal places.
