```c
// Global variables
// (None)

// This function is the main entry point of the program.
// It reads an integer `x` from the standard input and performs the following:
// - If `x` is divisible by 11, it prints `2 * (x / 11)`.
// - If the remainder of `x` divided by 11 is greater than 6, it prints `2 * (x / 11) + 2`.
// - Otherwise, it prints `2 * (x / 11) + 1`.
