```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: A single integer `x`.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: `x` is a non-negative integer input through standard input.
    // Postcondition: The program prints the minimum number of times a person would need to hit a button to increase a counter to at least `x` if each hit increases the counter by either 6 or 5, followed by a newline.
