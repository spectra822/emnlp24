```c
// Global variables
int N;
int ans = 0;

// This is the main function that reads input for two strings `S` and `T` of length `N`.
// It then calculates the minimum length of a string that can be obtained by
// appending `S` to `T` such that `T` is a suffix of `S`.
// Finally, it prints the result.
int main()
  // No function calls
