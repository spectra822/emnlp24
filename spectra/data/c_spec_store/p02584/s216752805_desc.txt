// Main function that reads input and computes the minimum distance
// after performing a series of operations on the given values.
// It reads three integers x, k, and d, and computes the minimum distance
// that can be achieved by subtracting d from x, k times.
int main(int argv, char* argc[])
    // No calls to other functions
