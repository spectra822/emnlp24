```
int in()
    // Precondition: The input is available from the standard input stream.
    // Postcondition: An integer value is read from the input and returned. If the input starts with a '-', the returned integer is negative.

int cmp(T *a, T *b)
    // Precondition: The pointers `a` and `b` point to valid `T` structures.
    // Postcondition: Returns 0 if the ratio `r` of both structures is approximately equal (within a small epsilon), 1 if `b->r` is greater than `a->r`, and -1 otherwise.

int main()
    // Input format: 
    //   The first line contains two integers `N` and `W`.
    //   The next `N` lines each contain two integers `w` and `v`.
    // Output format: A single floating-point number with up to 6 decimal places.
    // Precondition: The global array `tbl` has been declared and the function `in` is available to read integers from input.
    // Postcondition: The maximum value that can be obtained with the given constraints is printed.
