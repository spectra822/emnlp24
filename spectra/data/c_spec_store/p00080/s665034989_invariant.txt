```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The input consists of multiple lines. Each line contains an integer `q`.
    // The input ends when a line contains `-1`.
    // Output format: For each integer `q`, the program outputs a single floating-point number with six decimal places.
    // Precondition: The variable `q` is a non-negative integer or `-1`.
    // Postcondition: The program computes the cube root of `q` using Newton's method and prints the result with six decimal places.
