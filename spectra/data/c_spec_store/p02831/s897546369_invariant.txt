```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: Two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: `a` and `b` are positive integers.
    // Postcondition: The smallest integer `x` such that `x` is a multiple of `a` and `x` is divisible by `b` is printed.
