```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`.
    // The next `n` lines contain integers separated by whitespace.
    // The input ends with a line containing the integer `0`.
    // Output format: The first line contains an integer representing the number of transformations.
    // The next line contains `n` integers separated by spaces.
    // Precondition: The input integers are within the range 0 to 100.
    // Postcondition: The program outputs the number of transformations required to reach a stable state
    // where each integer in the list matches the frequency of its occurrence, followed by the stabilized list.
