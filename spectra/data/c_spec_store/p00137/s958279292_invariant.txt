```c
int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `counter`.
    // Each of the next `counter` lines contains a single integer `x`.
    // Output format: For each case, the output starts with "Case i:", where `i` is the case number starting from 1.
    // This is followed by 10 lines of integers generated by the algorithm described in the code.
    // Precondition: The variable `counter` is a positive integer.
    // Postcondition: For each input integer `x`, a sequence of 10 integers is printed, each generated by squaring the previous number,
    // dividing by 100, and taking the result modulo 10000.
