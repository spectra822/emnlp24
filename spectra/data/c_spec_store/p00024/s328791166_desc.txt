// No global variables

// This function reads a floating-point value `v` in a loop until EOF is reached.
// For each value `v`, it calculates an integer `n` based on the given formula
// and prints the result. The formula used is `n = (int)((4.9 * v * v / 9.8 / 9.8) + 5) / 5`,
// incremented by 1.
