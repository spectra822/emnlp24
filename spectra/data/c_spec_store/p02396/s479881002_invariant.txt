```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: A sequence of integers, each on a new line. The sequence ends with the integer 0.
    // Output format: For each integer in the input sequence (except the terminating 0), output "Case i: x" 
    // where i is the sequence number starting from 1 and x is the integer value. Each output is on a new line.
    // Precondition: The input consists of integers, and there is at least one integer before the terminating 0.
    // Postcondition: The program prints the sequence of integers with their respective case numbers, and terminates after processing the integer 0.
