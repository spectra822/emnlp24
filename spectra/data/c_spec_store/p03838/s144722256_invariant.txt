```c
int main()
    // Input format: Two integers `x` and `y`, separated by a space.
    // Output format: A single integer followed by a newline.
    // Precondition: The variables `x` and `y` are integers taken as input from STDIN.
    // Postcondition: The variable `ans` is calculated based on the logic of the if-else conditions and printed to STDOUT.
