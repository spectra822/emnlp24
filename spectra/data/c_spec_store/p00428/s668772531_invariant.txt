```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` on the first line.
    // Followed by `n` lines each containing `m` integers.
    // The input terminates when both `n` and `m` are zero.
    // Output format: For each test case, a single line containing `m` integers separated by spaces.
    // Precondition: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and the integers provided in the input are valid.
    // Postcondition: For each test case, the program prints the column indices (1-based) in descending order of their sums.
