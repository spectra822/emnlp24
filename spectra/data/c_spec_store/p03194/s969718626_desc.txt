```c
// Global variables
long n, p, ans = 1;

// The main function that reads input values `n` and `p`.
// It then calculates the largest integer `ans` such that `ans^n` divides `p`.
// The function iterates over possible factors of `p` and calculates the highest power of each factor that divides `p`.
// If the count of a factor is at least `n`, the factor is raised to the power of `count/n` and multiplied to `ans`.
// If `p` is greater than 1 after factorization and `n` equals 1, `p` is multiplied to `ans`.
// Finally, it prints the result `ans`.
