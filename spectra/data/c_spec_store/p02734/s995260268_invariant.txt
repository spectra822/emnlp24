```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains two integers `n` and `s`, separated by a whitespace.
    //               The next line contains `n` integers, separated by whitespace.
    // Output format: A single number.
    // Precondition: `n` and `s` are non-negative integers. The array `a` is of size `n` and contains non-negative integers.
    // Postcondition: The number of valid subsequences such that their sum does not exceed `s` is printed, modulo 998244353.
