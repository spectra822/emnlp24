```c
int main(void)
    // Input format: The first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `q` separated by spaces.
    // The next `q` lines each contain a single integer.
    // Output format: A single word "Yes" or "No".
    // Precondition: `n`, `m`, and `q` are non-negative integers.
    // Postcondition: The program prints "Yes" if the sequence of operations can be completed, otherwise it prints "No".
