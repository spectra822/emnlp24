```c
// Global variables
// None

// Main function to determine if all elements can be matched within constraints.
// It takes `n`, `m`, and `q` as input, representing the number of elements, the maximum element value, and the number of operations respectively.
// It reads `q` operations and processes them to check if all elements can be matched.
// The function prints "Yes" if all elements can be matched, otherwise "No".
int main(void)
    // Calls min(...)
