int in()
    // Precondition: The input stream is ready to provide characters.
    // Postcondition: An integer value read from the input stream is returned.

int main()
    // Input format: The first line contains an integer `n`. The second line contains two integers `x` and `y`.
    // The next `n` lines each contain four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, separated by whitespace.
    // Output format: A single integer.
    // Precondition: The input values `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers.
    // Postcondition: The maximum possible value of the sum of `d` values, subject to constraints, is printed.
