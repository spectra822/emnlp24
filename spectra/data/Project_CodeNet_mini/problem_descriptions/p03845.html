<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Joisino is about to compete in the final round of a certain programming competition.
In this contest, there are <var>N</var> problems, numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.
Joisino knows that it takes her <var>T_i</var> seconds to solve problem <var>i(1≦i≦N)</var>.</p>
<p>Also, there are <var>M</var> kinds of drinks offered to the contestants, numbered <var>1</var> through <var>M</var>.
If Joisino takes drink <var>i(1≦i≦M)</var>, her brain will be stimulated and the time it takes for her to solve problem <var>P_i</var> will become <var>X_i</var> seconds.
It does not affect the time to solve the other problems.</p>
<p>A contestant is allowed to take exactly one of the drinks before the start of the contest.
For each drink, Joisino wants to know how many seconds it takes her to solve all the problems if she takes that drink.
Here, assume that the time it takes her to solve all the problems is equal to the sum of the time it takes for her to solve individual problems.
Your task is to write a program to calculate it instead of her.</p>
