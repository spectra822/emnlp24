<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Takahashi bought a piece of apple pie at ABC Confiserie. According to his memory, he paid <var>N</var> yen (the currency of Japan) for it.</p>
<p>The consumption tax rate for foods in this shop is <var>8</var> percent. That is, to buy an apple pie priced at <var>X</var> yen before tax, you have to pay <var>X \times 1.08</var> yen (rounded down to the nearest integer).</p>
<p>Takahashi forgot the price of his apple pie before tax, <var>X</var>, and wants to know it again. Write a program that takes <var>N</var> as input and finds <var>X</var>. We assume <var>X</var> is an integer.</p>
<p>If there are multiple possible values for <var>X</var>, find any one of them. Also, Takahashi's memory of <var>N</var>, the amount he paid, may be incorrect. If no value could be <var>X</var>, report that fact.</p>
