<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>We have <var>N</var> cards. A number <var>a_i</var> is written on the <var>i</var>-th card.<br/>
Alice and Bob will play a game using these cards. In this game, Alice and Bob alternately take one card. Alice goes first.<br/>
The game ends when all the cards are taken by the two players, and the score of each player is the sum of the numbers written on the cards he/she has taken. When both players take the optimal strategy to maximize their scores, find Alice's score minus Bob's score.</p>
