<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke has a fair <var>N</var>-sided die that shows the integers from <var>1</var> to <var>N</var> with equal probability and a fair coin. He will play the following game with them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Throw the die. The current score is the result of the die.</li>
<li>As long as the score is between <var>1</var> and <var>K-1</var> (inclusive), keep flipping the coin. The score is doubled each time the coin lands heads up, and the score becomes <var>0</var> if the coin lands tails up.</li>
<li>The game ends when the score becomes <var>0</var> or becomes <var>K</var> or above. Snuke wins if the score is <var>K</var> or above, and loses if the score is <var>0</var>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are given <var>N</var> and <var>K</var>. Find the probability that Snuke wins the game.</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print the probability that Snuke wins the game. The output is considered correct when the absolute or relative error is at most <var>10^{-9}</var>.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the die shows <var>1</var>, Snuke needs to get four consecutive heads from four coin flips to obtain a score of <var>10</var> or above. The probability of this happening is <var>\frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{48}</var>.</li>
<li>If the die shows <var>2</var>, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of <var>10</var> or above. The probability of this happening is <var>\frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^3 = \frac{1}{24}</var>.</li>
<li>If the die shows <var>3</var>, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of <var>10</var> or above. The probability of this happening is <var>\frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{12}</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the probability that Snuke wins is <var>\frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{7}{48} \simeq 0.1458333333</var>.</p>
