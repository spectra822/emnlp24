<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There are <var>N</var> towns in Takahashi Kingdom. They are conveniently numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>Takahashi the king is planning to go on a tour of inspection for <var>M</var> days. He will determine a sequence of towns <var>c</var>, and visit town <var>c_i</var> on the <var>i</var>-th day. That is, on the <var>i</var>-th day, he will travel from his current location to town <var>c_i</var>. If he is already at town <var>c_i</var>, he will stay at that town. His location just before the beginning of the tour is town <var>1</var>, the capital. The tour ends at town <var>c_M</var>, without getting back to the capital. </p>
<p>The problem is that there is no paved road in this kingdom. He decided to resolve this issue by paving the road himself while traveling. When he travels from town <var>a</var> to town <var>b</var>, there will be a newly paved one-way road from town <var>a</var> to town <var>b</var>.</p>
<p>Since he cares for his people, he wants the following condition to be satisfied after his tour is over: "it is possible to travel from any town to any other town by traversing roads paved by him". How many sequences of towns <var>c</var> satisfy this condition?</p>
