<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>We have a canvas divided into a grid with <var>H</var> rows and <var>W</var> columns. The square at the <var>i</var>-th row from the top and the <var>j</var>-th column from the left is represented as <var>(i, j)</var>.<br/>
Initially, all the squares are white. square1001 wants to draw a picture with black paint. His specific objective is to make Square <var>(i, j)</var> black when <var>s_{i, j}=</var> <code>#</code>, and to make Square <var>(i, j)</var> white when <var>s_{i, j}=</var> <code>.</code>.<br/>
However, since he is not a good painter, he can only choose two squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent and paint those squares black, for some number of times (possibly zero). He may choose squares that are already painted black, in which case the color of those squares remain black.<br/>
Determine if square1001 can achieve his objective.  </p>
