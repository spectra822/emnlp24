<h2>C - Decoding Ancient Messages</h2>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
Professor Y's work is to dig up ancient artifacts. Recently, he found a lot of strange stone plates, each of which has $N^2$ characters arranged in an $N \times N$ matrix. Further research revealed that each plate represents a message of length $N$. Also, the procedure to decode the message from a plate was turned out to be the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Select $N$ characters from the plate one by one so that any two characters are neither in the same row nor in the same column.</li>
<li>Create a string by concatenating the selected characters.</li>
<li>Among all possible strings obtained by the above steps, find the lexicographically smallest one. It is the message represented by this plate.</li>
</ol>

<p>
NOTE: The order of the characters is defined as the same as the order of their ASCII values (that is, $\mathtt{A} \lt \mathtt{B} \lt \cdots \lt \mathtt{Z} \lt \mathtt{a} \lt \mathtt{b} \lt \cdots \lt \mathtt{z}$).
</p>

<p>
After struggling with the plates, Professor Y gave up decoding messages by hand. You, a great programmer and Y's old friend, was asked for a help. Your task is to write a program to decode the messages hidden in the plates.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input is formated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>$N$<br>$c_{11} c_{12} \cdots c_{1N}$<br>$c_{21} c_{22} \cdots c_{2N}$<br>:<br>:<br>$c_{N1} c_{N2} \cdots c_{NN}$</blockquote>

<p>
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 50$). Each of the subsequent $N$ lines contains a string of $N$ characters. Each character in the string is an uppercase or lowercase English letter (<code>A</code>-<code>Z</code>, <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Print the message represented by the plate in a line.</p>
