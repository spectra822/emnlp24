<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>A professor invented Cookie Breeding Machine for his students who like cookies very much. </p>
<p>When one cookie with the taste of <var>x</var> is put into the machine and a non-negative integer <var>y</var> less than or equal to <var>127</var> is input on the machine,
        it consumes the cookie and generates two cookies with the taste of <var>y</var> and (<var>x</var> XOR <var>y</var>). </p>
<p>Here, XOR represents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">Bitwise Exclusive OR</a>. </p>
<p>At first, there is only one cookie and the taste of it is <var>D</var> . </p>
<p>Find the maximum value of the sum of the taste of the exactly <var>N</var> cookies generated after the following operation is conducted <var>N-1</var> times. </p>
<ol>
<li>Put one of the cookies into the machine. </li>
<li>Input a non-negative integer less than or equal to <var>127</var> on the machine. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>1 \leq T \leq 1000</var></li>
<li><var>1 \leq N_t \leq 1000</var> <var>(1 \leq t \leq T)</var></li>
<li><var>1 \leq D_t \leq 127</var> <var>(1 \leq t \leq T)</var></li>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre>
<var>T</var>
<var>N_1</var> <var>D_1</var>
:
<var>N_T</var> <var>D_T</var>
</pre>
<p>
            The input consists of multiple test cases. An Integer <var>T</var> that represents the number of test cases is given on line <var>1</var>. <br/>
            Each test case is given on the next <var>T</var> lines. <br/>
            In the <var>t</var>-th test case (<var> 1 \leq t \leq T </var>),
            <var>N_t</var> that represents the number of cookies generated through the operations and <var>D_t</var> that represents the taste of the initial cookie are given separated by space. <br/>
</p>
</section></div>
<div class="part"><section>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the maximum value of the sum of the taste of the <var>N</var> cookies generated through the operations on one line. </p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
<pre>
255
400
10
</pre>
<p>
        On the 1st test case, if the machine is used as follows, three cookies with the taste of <var>61</var>, <var>95</var> and <var>99</var> are generated.
        Since the sum of these values is maximum among all possible ways, the answer is <var>255</var>.
        <ol>
<li>Put the cookie with the taste of <var>1</var> and input an integer <var>60</var> on the machine, lose the cookie and get two cookies with the taste of <var>60</var> and <var>61</var>. </li>
<li>Put the cookie with the taste of <var>60</var> and input an integer <var>99</var> on the machine, lose the cookie and get two cookies with the taste of <var>99</var> and <var>95</var>. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
        On the 3rd test case, the machine may not be used.
