<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke has decided to play with a six-sided die. Each of its six sides shows an integer <var>1</var> through <var>6</var>, and two numbers on opposite sides always add up to <var>7</var>.</p>
<p>Snuke will first put the die on the table with an arbitrary side facing upward, then repeatedly perform the following operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation: Rotate the die <var>90°</var> toward one of the following directions: left, right, front (the die will come closer) and back (the die will go farther). Then, obtain <var>y</var> points where <var>y</var> is the number written in the side facing upward.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let us consider the situation where the side showing <var>1</var> faces upward, the near side shows <var>5</var> and the right side shows <var>4</var>, as illustrated in the figure.
If the die is rotated toward the right as shown in the figure, the side showing <var>3</var> will face upward.
Besides, the side showing <var>4</var> will face upward if the die is rotated toward the left, the side showing <var>2</var> will face upward if the die is rotated toward the front, and the side showing <var>5</var> will face upward if the die is rotated toward the back.</p>
