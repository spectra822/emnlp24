<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi is an expert of Clone Jutsu, a secret art that creates copies of his body.</p>
<p>On a number line, there are <var>N</var> copies of Takahashi, numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.
The <var>i</var>-th copy is located at position <var>X_i</var> and starts walking with velocity <var>V_i</var> in the positive direction at time <var>0</var>.</p>
<p>Kenus is a master of Transformation Jutsu, and not only can he change into a person other than himself, but he can also transform another person into someone else.</p>
<p>Kenus can select some of the copies of Takahashi at time <var>0</var>, and transform them into copies of Aoki, another Ninja.
The walking velocity of a copy does not change when it transforms.
From then on, whenever a copy of Takahashi and a copy of Aoki are at the same coordinate, that copy of Takahashi transforms into a copy of Aoki.</p>
<p>Among the <var>2^N</var> ways to transform some copies of Takahashi into copies of Aoki at time <var>0</var>, in how many ways will all the copies of Takahashi become copies of Aoki after a sufficiently long time?
Find the count modulo <var>10^9+7</var>.</p>
