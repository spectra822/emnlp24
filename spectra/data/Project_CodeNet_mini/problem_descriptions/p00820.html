<p>
The fact that any positive integer has a representation as the sum of at most four positive
squares (i.e. squares of positive integers) is known as Lagrange’s Four-Square Theorem. The
first published proof of the theorem was given by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1770. Your mission
however is not to explain the original proof nor to discover a new proof but to show that the
theorem holds for some specific numbers by counting how many such possible representations
there are.
</p>
<p>
For a given positive integer n, you should report the number of all representations of n as the
sum of at most four positive squares. The order of addition does not matter, e.g. you should
consider 4<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> and 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> are the same representation.
</p>
<p>
For example, let’s check the case of 25. This integer has just three representations 1<sup>2</sup> +2<sup>2</sup> +2<sup>2</sup> +4<sup>2</sup> ,
3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> , and 5<sup>2</sup> . Thus you should report 3 in this case. Be careful not to count 4<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> and
3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> separately.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is composed of at most 255 lines, each containing a single positive integer less than
2<sup>15</sup> , followed by a line containing a single zero. The last line is not a part of the input data.

</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
The output should be composed of lines, each containing a single integer. No other characters
should appear in the output.
</p>
<p>
The output integer corresponding to the input integer <i>n</i> is the number of all representations
of <i>n</i> as the sum of at most four positive squares.
