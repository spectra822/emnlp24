<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi and Snuke came up with a game that uses a number sequence, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prepare a sequence of length <var>M</var> consisting of integers between <var>0</var> and <var>2^N-1</var> (inclusive): <var>a = a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snuke first does the operation below as many times as he likes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a positive integer <var>d</var>, and for each <var>i</var> <var>(1 \leq i \leq M)</var>, in binary, set the <var>d</var>-th least significant bit of <var>a_i</var> to <var>0</var>. (Here the least significant bit is considered the <var>1</var>-st least significant bit.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Snuke finishes doing operations, Takahashi tries to sort <var>a</var> in ascending order by doing the operation below some number of times. Here <var>a</var> is said to be in ascending order when <var>a_i \leq a_{i + 1}</var> for all <var>i</var> <var>(1 \leq i \leq M - 1)</var>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose two adjacent elements of <var>a</var>: <var>a_i</var> and <var>a_{i + 1}</var>. If, in binary, these numbers differ in exactly one bit, swap <var>a_i</var> and <var>a_{i + 1}</var>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <var>2^{NM}</var> different sequences of length <var>M</var> consisting of integers between <var>0</var> and <var>2^N-1</var> that can be used in the game.</p>
<p>How many among them have the following property: if used in the game, there is always a way for Takahashi to sort the sequence in ascending order regardless of Snuke's operations? Find the count modulo <var>(10^9 + 7)</var>.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print the number, modulo <var>(10^9 + 7)</var>, of sequences with the property: if used in the game, there is always a way for Takahashi to sort the sequence in ascending order regardless of Snuke's operations.</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3><pre>2 5

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>352
</pre>
<p>Consider the case <var>a = 1, 3, 1, 3, 1</var> for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the least significant bit of each element of <var>a</var> is set to <var>0</var>, <var>a = 0, 2, 0, 2, 0</var>;</li>
<li>When the second least significant bit of each element of <var>a</var> is set to <var>0</var>, <var>a = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1</var>;</li>
<li>When the least two significant bits of each element of <var>a</var> are set to <var>0</var>, <var>a = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of the cases above and the case when Snuke does no operation to change <var>a</var>, we can sort the sequence by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that differ in exactly one bit.
Thus, this sequence has the property: if used in the game, there is always a way for Takahashi to sort the sequence in ascending order regardless of Snuke's operations.</p>
