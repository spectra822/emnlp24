<h3><u>Almost Identical Programs</u></h3>

<p>
The programming contest named
<i>Concours de Programmation Comtemporaine Interuniversitaire</i> (CPCI)
has a judging system similar to that of ICPC;
contestants have to submit correct outputs for two different inputs
to be accepted as a correct solution.

Each of the submissions should include the program that generated
the output.  A pair of submissions is judged to be a correct
solution when, in addition to the correctness of the outputs, they
include an identical program.
</p>
<p>
Many contestants, however, do not stop including a different version
of their programs in their second submissions, after modifying a
single string literal in their programs representing 
the input file name, attempting to process different input.

The organizers of CPCI are exploring the possibility of showing a
special error message for such <em>close</em> submissions, 
indicating contestants what's wrong with such submissions.

Your task is to detect such close submissions.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>


<p>
The input consists of at most 100 datasets, each in the following format.
</p>

<pre>
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub>
</pre>

<p>
Each of <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>s</i><sub>2</sub> is
a string written in a line, with the length between 1 and 200, inclusive.
They are the first and the second submitted programs respectively.

A program consists of lowercase letters (<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, ..., <tt>z</tt>), uppercase letters (<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, ..., <tt>Z</tt>),
digits (<tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, ..., <tt>9</tt>), double quotes (<tt>"</tt>), and semicolons (<tt>;</tt>).
When double quotes occur in a program, there are always even number of them.
</p>


<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing one '<tt>.</tt>' (period).
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>



<p>
For each dataset, print the judge result in a line.
</p>
<p>
If the given two programs are identical, print <tt>IDENTICAL</tt>.
If two programs differ with only one corresponding string literal, print <tt>CLOSE</tt>.
Otherwise, print <tt>DIFFERENT</tt>.

A string literal is a possibly empty sequence of characters between an
odd-numbered occurrence of a double quote and the next occurrence of
a double quote.
</p>
