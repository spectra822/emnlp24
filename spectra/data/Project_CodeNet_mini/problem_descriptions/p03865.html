<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There is a string <var>s</var> of length <var>3</var> or greater.
No two neighboring characters in <var>s</var> are equal.</p>
<p>Takahashi and Aoki will play a game against each other.
The two players alternately performs the following operation, Takahashi going first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove one of the characters in <var>s</var>, excluding both ends. However, a character cannot be removed if removal of the character would result in two neighboring equal characters in <var>s</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The player who becomes unable to perform the operation, loses the game. Determine which player will win when the two play optimally.</p>

<p>Takahashi, who goes first, cannot perform the operation, since removal of the <code>b</code>, which is the only character not at either ends of <var>s</var>, would result in <var>s</var> becoming <code>aa</code>, with two <code>a</code>s neighboring.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3><pre>First

<p>When Takahashi removes <code>b</code> from <var>s</var>, it becomes <code>ac</code>.
Then, Aoki cannot perform the operation, since there is no character in <var>s</var>, excluding both ends.</p>
