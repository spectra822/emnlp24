<!-- end en only -->

<p>
Chief Judge's log, stardate 48642.5.
We have decided to make a problem from elementary number theory.
The problem looks like finding all prime factors of a positive integer,
but it is not.

A positive integer whose remainder divided by 7 is either 1 or 6 is called
a 7<b><i>N</i></b>+{1,6} number.
But as it is hard to pronounce,
we shall call it a <em>Monday-Saturday number</em>.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
For Monday-Saturday numbers <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>,
we say <I>a</I> is a Monday-Saturday divisor of <I>b</I>
if there exists a Monday-Saturday number <I>x</I>
such that <I>a</I><I>x</I> = <I>b</I>.
It is easy to show that
for any Monday-Saturday numbers <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>,
it holds that <I>a</I> is
a Monday-Saturday divisor of <I>b</I>
if and only if
<I>a</I> is a divisor of <I>b</I> in the usual sense.

<p>
We call a Monday-Saturday number a <em>Monday-Saturday prime</em>
if it is greater than 1 and has no Monday-Saturday divisors
other than itself and 1.
A Monday-Saturday number which is a prime in the usual sense
is a Monday-Saturday prime
but the converse does not always hold.
For example, 27 is a Monday-Saturday prime
although it is not a prime in the usual sense.
We call a Monday-Saturday prime
which is a Monday-Saturday divisor of a Monday-Saturday number <I>a</I>
a <em>Monday-Saturday prime factor</em> of <I>a</I>.
For example, 27 is one of the Monday-Saturday prime factors of 216,
since 27 is a Monday-Saturday prime
and 216 = 27 &times; 8 holds.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
<p>
<!-- begin en only -->
Any Monday-Saturday number greater than 1
can be expressed as a product of one or more Monday-Saturday primes.
The expression is not always unique
even if differences in order are ignored.
For example,
<!-- end en only -->
216 = 6 &times; 6 &times; 6 = 8 &times; 27
<!-- begin en only -->
holds.
<!-- end en only -->

<p>
Our contestants should write a program that outputs
all Monday-Saturday prime factors
of each input Monday-Saturday number.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->


<h3>Input</h3>

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
The input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a single
Monday-Saturday number.
Each Monday-Saturday number is greater than 1
and less than 300000 (three hundred thousand).
The end of the input is indicated by a line
containing a single digit 1.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->


<h3>Output</h3>

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
For each input Monday-Saturday number,
it should be printed, followed by a colon `:'
and the list of its Monday-Saturday prime factors on a single line.
Monday-Saturday prime factors should be listed in ascending order
and each should be preceded by a space.
All the Monday-Saturday prime factors should be printed only once
even if they divide the input Monday-Saturday number more than once.
