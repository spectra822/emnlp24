<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p><var>2N</var> players are running a competitive table tennis training on <var>N</var> tables numbered from <var>1</var> to <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>The training consists of <i>rounds</i>.
In each round, the players form <var>N</var> pairs, one pair per table.
In each pair, competitors play a match against each other.
As a result, one of them wins and the other one loses.</p>
<p>The winner of the match on table <var>X</var> plays on table <var>X-1</var> in the next round,
except for the winner of the match on table <var>1</var> who stays at table <var>1</var>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the loser of the match on table <var>X</var> plays on table <var>X+1</var> in the next round,
except for the loser of the match on table <var>N</var> who stays at table <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>Two friends are playing their first round matches on distinct tables <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>.
Let's assume that the friends are strong enough to win or lose any match at will.
What is the smallest number of rounds after which the friends can get to play a match against each other?</p>
