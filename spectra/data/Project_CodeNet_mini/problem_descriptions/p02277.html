Let's arrange a deck of cards. Your task is to sort totally n cards. A card consists of a part of a suit (S, H, C or D) and an number. Write a program which sorts such cards based on the following pseudocode:
</p>

<pre>
Partition(A, p, r)
1 x = A[r]
2 i = p-1
3 for j = p to r-1
4     do if A[j] <= x
5        then i = i+1
6            exchange A[i] and A[j] 
7 exchange A[i+1] and A[r]
8 return i+1


Quicksort(A, p, r)
1 if p < r
2    then q = Partition(A, p, r)
3        run Quicksort(A, p, q-1)
4        run Quicksort(A, q+1, r)
</pre>

<p>
Here, A is an array which represents a deck of cards and comparison operations are performed based on the numbers.
</p>

<p>
Your program should also report the stability of the output for the given input (instance). Here, 'stability of the output' means that: cards with the same value appear in the output in the same order as they do in the input (instance).
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line contains an integer <i>n</i>, the number of cards.
</p>

<p>
<i>n</i> cards are given in the following lines. Each card is given in a line and represented by a pair of a character and an integer separated by a single space.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
In the first line, print the stability ("<span>Stable</span>" or "<span>Not stable</span>") of this output.
</p>

<p>
In the following lines, print the arranged cards in the same manner of that of the input.
</p>
