<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>You are given two integer sequences <var>S</var> and <var>T</var> of length <var>N</var> and <var>M</var>, respectively, both consisting of integers between <var>1</var> and <var>10^5</var> (inclusive).</p>
<p>In how many pairs of a subsequence of <var>S</var> and a subsequence of <var>T</var> do the two subsequences are the same in content?</p>
<p>Here the subsequence of <var>A</var> is a sequence obtained by removing zero or more elements from <var>A</var> and concatenating the remaining elements without changing the order.</p>
<p>For both <var>S</var> and <var>T</var>, we distinguish two subsequences if the sets of the indices of the removed elements are different, even if the subsequences are the same in content.</p>
<p>Since the answer can be tremendous, print the number modulo <var>10^9+7</var>.</p>
