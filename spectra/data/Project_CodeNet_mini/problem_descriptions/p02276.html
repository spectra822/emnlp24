<p>
Quick sort is based on the Divide-and-conquer approach. In QuickSort(A, p, r), first, a procedure Partition(A, p, r) divides an array A[p..r] into two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] such that each element of A[p..q-1] is less than or equal to A[q], which is, inturn, less than or equal to each element of A[q+1..r]. It also computes the index q.
</p>

<p>
In the conquer processes, the two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] are sorted by recursive calls of QuickSort(A, p, q-1) and QuickSort(A, q+1, r).
</p>


<p>
Your task is to read a sequence A and perform the Partition based on the following pseudocode:
</p>

<pre>
Partition(A, p, r)
1 x = A[r]
2 i = p-1
3 for j = p to r-1
4     do if A[j] <= x
5        then i = i+1
6            exchange A[i] and A[j] 
7 exchange A[i+1] and A[r]
8 return i+1
</pre>

</p>
Note that, in this algorithm, Partition always selects an element A[r] as a pivot element around which to partition the array A[p..r].
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line of the input includes an integer <i>n</i>, the number of elements in the sequence A.
</p>
<p>
In the second line, <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>i</i> = 1,2,...,<i>n</i>), elements of the sequence are given separated by space characters.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>


<p>
Print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character. The element which is selected as the pivot of the partition should be indicated by <span>[</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>]</span>.
</p>
