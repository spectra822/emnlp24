<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs <var>700</var> yen (the currency of Japan), plus <var>100</var> yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions).</p>
<p>A customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string <var>S</var>. <var>S</var> is three characters long, and if the first character in <var>S</var> is <code>o</code>, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is <code>x</code>, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in <var>S</var> mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.</p>
<p>Write a program that, when <var>S</var> is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.</p>
