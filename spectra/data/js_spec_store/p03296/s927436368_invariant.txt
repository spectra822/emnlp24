// Segment 1: Function Definition and Input Handling
// Precondition: The Main function is called with a string input representing the test case.
// Postcondition: The input string is split into an array of strings based on newline characters.
function Main(input) {
    input = input.split("\n");

    // Segment 2: Variable Initialization
    // Precondition: The input array has at least two elements, where the first element is the count of numbers, and the second element is a space-separated string of numbers.
    // Postcondition: Variables sum and now are initialized. The second element of the input array is split into an array of numbers (arr), and a "#" is appended to it.
    var sum = 0;
    var now = 1;
    var arr = input[1].split(" ");
    arr.push("#");

    // Segment 3: Loop through the Array
    // Precondition: arr is an array of strings where the last element is "#".
    // Postcondition: The sum is calculated based on the number of consecutive identical elements in the array.
    for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) {
            now++;
        } else {
            sum += Math.ceil((now - 1) / 2);
            now = 1;
        }
    }

    // Segment 4: Output the Result
    // Precondition: The sum variable holds the calculated result.
    // Postcondition: The sum is printed to the console.
    console.log(sum)
}

// Input: A string from standard input, where the first line is an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers.
// Example Input:
// 5
// 1 1 2 2 2

// Output: A single integer representing the calculated sum.
// Example Output:
// 2
