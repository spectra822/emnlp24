// Segment 1: Read and process input

// Precondition: The program is run in an environment where the 'fs' module is available and a valid input is provided via '/dev/stdin'.
// Postcondition: The input is read from '/dev/stdin', trimmed, and split into an array of strings, each representing a line of input.

// Segment 2: Iterate over each line of input

// Precondition: 'Arr' is an array of strings where each string represents a line of input.
// Postcondition: For each element in 'Arr', the program processes the string to determine the number of exact matches and partial matches between two 4-digit numbers.
// Input format: Each line contains two 4-digit numbers separated by a space, with the last line being "0 0".
// Output format: For each line (except the last one), output two integers separated by a space, representing the number of exact matches and partial matches respectively.

    // Segment 4: Split the numbers into individual digits

    // Precondition: 'arr' contains two strings, each representing a 4-digit number.

    // Segment 6: Compare digits for exact and partial matches

    // Precondition: 'x' and 'y' are arrays of characters representing the digits of the two 4-digit numbers, and 'h' and 'b' are initialized to 0.
