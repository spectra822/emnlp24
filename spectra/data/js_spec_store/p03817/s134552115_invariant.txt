// Segment 1: Function definition and input handling
// Precondition: The program receives a string input from standard input, which represents the contents of a file.
// Postcondition: The input string is trimmed, split by newlines, and the first element is split by spaces to extract the integer N.
const main = arg => {
    arg = arg.trim().split("\n");
    const N = parseInt(arg[0].split(" ")[0]);

    // Segment 2: Calculation of temp and rest
    // Precondition: N is a valid integer greater than or equal to 0.
    // Postcondition: temp holds the integer division of N by 11, and rest holds the remainder when N is divided by 11.
    let temp = Math.floor(N / 11);
    let rest = N % 11;

    // Segment 3: Output the result
    // Precondition: temp and rest are correctly calculated based on the value of N.
    // Postcondition: The program outputs an integer which is the result of (temp * 2) + Math.ceil(rest / 6).
    // Input format: A single integer N on a single line.
    // Output format: A single integer result on a single line.
    console.log((temp * 2) + Math.ceil(rest / 6));

// Segment 4: Reading input from standard input and invoking the main function
// Precondition: The program is executed in an environment where the input is provided via standard input.
// Postcondition: The main function is called with the input string read from standard input.
