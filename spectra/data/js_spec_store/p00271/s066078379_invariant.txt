// Segment 1: Variable Declarations and File Reading
// Precondition: The program is executed in an environment where '/dev/stdin' contains the input data.
// Postcondition: The variable `input` holds the content of the file as a string, and `Arr` is an array of strings where each element is a line from the input file.
var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');

// Segment 2: Loop to Process Each Line of Input
// Precondition: `Arr` is an array of strings where each string is a line of input containing two space-separated integers.
// Postcondition: For each line in `Arr`, the program logs the difference between the two integers to the console.
for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    // Segment 2.1: Splitting and Mapping Line to Numbers
    // Precondition: `Arr[i]` is a string containing two space-separated integers.
    // Postcondition: `arr` is an array of two integers parsed from `Arr[i]`.
    var arr = Arr[i].split(" ").map(Number);

    // Segment 2.2: Calculating and Logging the Difference
    // Precondition: `arr` is an array of two integers.
    // Postcondition: The difference `arr[0] - arr[1]` is logged to the console.
