// Segment 1: Import and Read Input
// Precondition: The program is running in an environment where the 'fs' module is available and the input is provided through '/dev/stdin'.
// Postcondition: The 'inputs' variable is an array of strings, where each string is a line of input.
const main = (inputs) => {
    // Segment 2: Parse Input
    // Precondition: 'inputs' is an array of strings, and the first element represents a number in string format.
    // Postcondition: 'length' is a number parsed from the first element of the 'inputs' array.
    const length = Number(inputs[0]);

    // Segment 3: Calculate and Print Result
    // Precondition: 'length' is a number.
    // Postcondition: The cube of one-third of 'length' is calculated and printed to the console with 12 decimal places.
    // Input: A single integer value representing the length.
    // Output: A single floating-point number printed to the console with 12 decimal places.
    console.log((length / 3 * length / 3 * length / 3).toFixed(12));

// Segment 4: Execute Main Function
// Precondition: 'fs' module is available and '/dev/stdin' contains input.
// Postcondition: The 'main' function is called with the input read from '/dev/stdin'.
main(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'UTF-8').trim().split("\n"));
