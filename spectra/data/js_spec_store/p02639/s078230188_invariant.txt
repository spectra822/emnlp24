// Segment 1: Function Definition and Input Handling

// Precondition: The input is provided as a single string with space-separated integers.
// Postcondition: The input string is split into an array of strings, each representing a number.
function Main(input) {
    const numbers = input.split(' ');

    // Segment 2: Loop to Find the First Occurrence of '0'

    // Precondition: 'numbers' is an array of strings representing numbers.
    // Postcondition: If '0' is found in the array, its position (1-based index) is logged to the console.
    for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] == 0) {
            const ans = i + 1;

// Segment 3: Reading Input and Invoking the Main Function

// Precondition: The script is executed in an environment where '/dev/stdin' provides the input.
// Postcondition: The Main function is called with the content of '/dev/stdin' as argument.
Main(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8'));
