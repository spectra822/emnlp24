// Segment 1: Input Reading and Parsing
// Precondition: The input is provided via stdin and read as a single string.
// Postcondition: The input string is trimmed and split into an array of strings, with each element representing a line of input.
const main = stdin => {
    const input = stdin.trim().split('\n')
     
    // Segment 2: Variable Declarations and Parsing
    // Precondition: The input array has at least one element, and the first element contains three space-separated integers.
    // Postcondition: The integers A, B, and C are parsed from the first element of the input array.
    const A = parseInt(input[0].split(" ")[0]);
    const B = parseInt(input[0].split(" ")[1]);
    const C = parseInt(input[0].split(" ")[2]);

    // Segment 3: Computation of Maximum Sound
    // Precondition: A, B, and C are defined and are integers.
    // Postcondition: The variable Maxsound is assigned the minimum value between the result of Math.floor(B / A) and C.
    const sound = Math.floor(B / A);
    let Maxsound;

    // Segment 4: Output
    // Precondition: Maxsound is defined and holds the computed maximum sound value.
    // Postcondition: The value of Maxsound is printed to the console.
    // Input format: A single string with three integers separated by spaces.
    // Output format: A single integer printed to the console.
    console.log(Maxsound);
}

// Precondition: The program is run in an environment where `/dev/stdin` is available and contains the input data.
// Postcondition: The main function is executed with the input data read from `/dev/stdin`.
