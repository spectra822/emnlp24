// Segment 1: main function declaration and input handling

// Precondition: The program is executed with a single argument, `stdin`, which is a string representing the standard input.
// Postcondition: The input string `stdin` is trimmed, split by newline characters, and stored in the `input` array. The first element of `input` is assigned to the variable `S`.

const main = stdin => {
    const input = stdin.trim().split('\n')
    const S = input[0]

    // Segment 2: Switch-case logic for determining the number of days until Sunday

    // Precondition: `S` is a string representing a day of the week in its abbreviated form (e.g., 'SUN', 'MON', etc.).
    // Postcondition: Based on the value of `S`, a number representing the days until Sunday is printed to the console.

    switch (S) {
        case 'SUN':
            console.log(7)
            break;
        case 'MON':
            console.log(6)
            break;
        case 'TUE':
            console.log(5)
            break;
        case 'WED':
            console.log(4)
            break;
        case 'THU':
            console.log(3)
            break;
        case 'FRI':
            console.log(2)
            break;
        case 'SAT':
            console.log(1)
            break;

        default:
            break;
    }
}

// Segment 3: Execution of the main function with input from the standard input

// Precondition: The script is run in an environment where the standard input is available and contains a single line representing a day of the week.
// Postcondition: The `main` function is executed with the contents of the standard input.

// Input format: A single string representing a day of the week in its abbreviated form, followed by a newline character.
// Output format: A single integer representing the number of days until Sunday, followed by a newline character.
