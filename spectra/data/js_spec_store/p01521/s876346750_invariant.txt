// Segment 1: Reading and trimming input

// Precondition: The program expects an input string from the standard input device.
// Postcondition: The variable 'str' contains the trimmed input string without leading or trailing whitespace.

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');
var str = input.trim();

// Segment 2: Replacing characters

// Precondition: The variable 'str' contains a string of characters that may include 'o' and 'x'.
// Postcondition: All consecutive 'o' characters in 'str' are replaced with '0' and all consecutive 'x' characters are replaced with '1'.

str = str.replace(/o+/g, 0);
str = str.replace(/x+/g, 1);

// Segment 3: Extracting characters and determining the result

// Precondition: The variable 'str' is a string with '0's and '1's.
// Postcondition: The variable 'ans' is determined based on the conditions applied to the first and last characters of 'str'.

var a = str[0];
var b = str[str.length - 1];
var ans = "x";
if (a == 0 && b == 1) ans = "o";
if (a == 0 && b == 0) ans = "o";
if (a == 1 && b == 0) ans = "o";

// Segment 4: Output the result

// Precondition: The variable 'ans' contains the result which is either 'o' or 'x'.
// Postcondition: The result stored in 'ans' is printed to the standard output.

// Input format: A single line string consisting of characters 'o' and 'x'.
// Example: "oxxoxoo"

// Output format: A single character 'o' or 'x'.
// Example: "o"

console.log(ans);
