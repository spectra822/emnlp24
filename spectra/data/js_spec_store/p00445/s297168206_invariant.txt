// Segment 1: Import and Read Input

// Postcondition: The input data is read and split into an array of strings, `Arr`, where each element is a line from the input.

// Segment 2: Processing Each Line of Input
// Precondition: `Arr` is an array of strings where each string is a line from the input.
// Postcondition: For each string in `Arr`, the counts of substrings "JOI" and "IOI" are calculated and printed.
// Input: Each line of the input is a string containing uppercase letters.
// Output: For each input line, two integers are printed on separate lines representing the counts of "JOI" and "IOI" respectively.

    // Precondition: `cntA` and `cntB` contain the counts of "JOI" and "IOI" substrings in `v` respectively.
    // Postcondition: The values of `cntA` and `cntB` are printed to the console.
