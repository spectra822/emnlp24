// Segment 1: Input Handling and Initial Setup

// Precondition: The program is executed and input is provided in the format specified below.
// Input format: The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100), the number of elements. 
// The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

// Postcondition: The input is split into lines, and the second line is further split into individual elements.

function Main(input) {
    input = input.split("\n");
    tmp = input[1].split(" ");

    // Segment 2: Variable Declarations and Initializations

    // Precondition: The input has been split into `input` array and `tmp` array containing the elements as strings.
    // Postcondition: Variables `Arrays`, `min`, `max`, and `totalNum` are declared and `totalNum` is initialized with the number of elements.

    var Arrays = [];
    var min;
    var max;
    var totalNum = parseInt(input[0], 10);

    // Segment 3: Array Parsing and Population

    // Precondition: `tmp` contains the string representation of the array elements.
    // Postcondition: `Arrays` contains the integer representation of the array elements.

    for (i = 0; i <= totalNum - 1; i++) {
        Arrays[i] = parseInt(tmp[i], 10);
    }

    // Segment 4: Finding Min and Max

    // Precondition: `Arrays` contains the integer representation of the array elements.
    // Postcondition: `min` and `max` hold the minimum and maximum values from the `Arrays`.

    min = Math.min(...Arrays);
    max = Math.max(...Arrays);

    // Segment 5: Output the Result

    // Precondition: `min` and `max` hold the minimum and maximum values from the `Arrays`.
    // Output format: A single integer representing the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

    // Postcondition: The difference between `max` and `min` is printed to the console.

    console.log(max - min);
}

// Precondition: The program is executed and input is provided in the format specified above.
// Postcondition: The main function is called with the provided input.
