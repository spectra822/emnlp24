// Segment 1: Reading input from stdin

// Precondition: The program is executed in an environment where '/dev/stdin' is available and contains the input data in the specified format.
// Postcondition: The variable 'input' contains the entire input data as a string.

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');

// Segment 2: Processing input into an array of lines

// Precondition: 'input' contains the entire input data as a string.
// Postcondition: 'Arr' is an array of strings, where each element is a line from the input. 'L' is an integer representing the number of lines to process.

var Arr = (input.trim()).split("\n");
var L = (Arr.shift()) - 0;

// Segment 3: Loop through each line and replace occurrences of "Hoshino" with "Hoshina"

// Precondition: 'Arr' is an array of strings with at least 'L' elements. 'L' is a non-negative integer.
// Postcondition: For each line in 'Arr', if the line contains "Hoshino", it is replaced with "Hoshina" and printed to stdout.

// Input format:
// The first line contains an integer L (the number of subsequent lines to process).
// The next L lines contain strings that may or may not contain the substring "Hoshino".

// Output format:
// For each of the L lines, if the line contains "Hoshino", it is replaced with "Hoshina" and printed.
// Each processed line is printed on a new line.
