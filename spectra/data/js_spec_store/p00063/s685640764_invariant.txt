// Segment 1: Reading input from stdin and preparing the array of strings

// Precondition: The program is executed in an environment where '/dev/stdin' is available
// and contains the input data in the specified format (multiple lines of strings).
var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');

// Postcondition: `input` contains the entire content read from '/dev/stdin' as a single string.
var Arr = (input.trim()).split("\n");

// Postcondition: `Arr` is an array of strings, each element representing a line from the input.

// Segment 2: Counting palindromic strings

// Precondition: `Arr` is an array of strings, each representing a line from the input.
var cnt = 0;

// Postcondition: `cnt` is initialized to 0.
Arr.forEach(function(v) {
    // Precondition: `v` is a string from the `Arr` array.
    var str = v.split("").reverse().join("");
    // Postcondition: `str` is the reverse of the string `v`.
    if (str == v) cnt++;
    // Postcondition: `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `v` is a palindrome.
});

// Postcondition: `cnt` contains the number of palindromic strings in the `Arr` array.

// Segment 3: Output the result

// Precondition: `cnt` is the number of palindromic strings found in the `Arr` array.
// Output format: A single integer printed to the console.
console.log(cnt);
// Postcondition: `cnt` is printed to the console.
