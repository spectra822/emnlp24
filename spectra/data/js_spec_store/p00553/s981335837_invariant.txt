// Segment 1: Reading and parsing input
// Precondition: The input is provided via '/dev/stdin' and consists of 5 lines of integers.
// Postcondition: The input is read, trimmed, split into lines, and converted into an array of numbers stored in `arr`.
var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');
var arr = input.trim().split("\n").map(Number);

// Segment 2: Initializing variables
// Precondition: `arr` is an array of at least 5 integers.
// Postcondition: Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `t` are initialized with values from `arr` and `t` is set to 0.
var a = arr[0];
var b = arr[1];
var c = arr[2];
var d = arr[3];
var e = arr[4];
var t = 0;

// Segment 3: Calculating time if `a` is negative
// Precondition: Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `t` are initialized.
// Postcondition: If `a` is negative, `t` is incremented by the cost to move `a` to 0, and `a` is set to 0.

// Segment 4: Calculating time for the remaining distance
// Precondition: Variables `a`, `b`, `e`, and `t` are properly set, with `a` being non-negative.
// Postcondition: `t` is incremented by the cost to move from `a` to `b`.
t += (b - a) * e;

// Segment 5: Output the result
// Precondition: The total time `t` has been calculated.
// Postcondition: The value of `t` is printed to the console.
// Output format: A single integer printed on one line.
