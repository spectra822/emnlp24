// Precondition: The program is executed in an environment where stdin is available and readable.
// Postcondition: The content of stdin is read as a UTF-8 string.

// Segment 2: Splitting the input string into an array of substrings
// Precondition: `inputString` contains a space-separated string of numbers.
// Postcondition: The input string is split into an array of substrings based on spaces.
let stringArray = inputString.split(' ');

// Segment 3: Converting the array of substrings to an array of numbers
// Precondition: `stringArray` contains an array of substrings representing numbers.
// Postcondition: The substrings are converted to an array of numbers.

// Segment 4: Sorting the array of numbers in ascending order
// Precondition: `numberArray` contains an array of numbers.
// Postcondition: The array of numbers is sorted in ascending order.

// Segment 5: Joining the sorted array of numbers into a space-separated string
// Precondition: `numberArray` contains a sorted array of numbers.
// Postcondition: The sorted array of numbers is joined into a single space-separated string.

// Segment 6: Outputting the resulting string
// Precondition: `outputString` contains a space-separated string of sorted numbers.
// Postcondition: The sorted numbers are printed to stdout.
// Input Format: A single line containing space-separated integers. Example: "3 8 1\n"
// Output Format: A single line containing the sorted integers, space-separated. Example: "1 3 8\n"
