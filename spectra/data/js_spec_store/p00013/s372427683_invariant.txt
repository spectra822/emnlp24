// Segment 1: Read and parse input
// Precondition: The input should be provided in the form of a string with each number on a new line, read from '/dev/stdin'.
// Postcondition: The variable 'Arr' contains an array of numbers parsed from the input string.
var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');
var Arr = (input.trim()).split("\n").map(Number);

// Segment 2: Initialize an empty array 'arr'
// Precondition: The variable 'Arr' should be an array of numbers.
// Postcondition: The variable 'arr' is an empty array ready to be used for stack operations.
var arr = [];

// Segment 3: Process each number in 'Arr'
// Precondition: 'Arr' is an array of numbers, and 'arr' is an empty array or contains numbers from previous operations.
// Postcondition: For each number in 'Arr', if the number is 0, the last element of 'arr' is removed and printed; otherwise, the number is added to 'arr'.
// Input format: Each number from the input is processed sequentially.
// Output format: For each 0 in the input, the last number added to 'arr' is printed on a new line.
